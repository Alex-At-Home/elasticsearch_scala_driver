  /** A case class representing the query to execute
    * [[https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.3/search-request-body.html Docs]]
    *
    * @param query The query term or terms that comprise the query
    * @param timeout A search timeout, bounding the search request to be executed within the specified time value and
    *                bail with the hits accumulated up to that point when expired. Defaults to no timeout.
    * @param from To retrieve hits from a certain offset. Defaults to 0.
    * @param size The number of hits to return. Defaults to 10. If you do not care about getting some hits back
    *             but only about the number of matches and/or aggregations, setting the value to 0 will help
    *             performance.
    * @param terminate_after The maximum number of documents to collect for each shard, upon reaching which the query
    *                        execution will terminate early. If set, the response will have a boolean field
    *                        terminated_early to indicate whether the query execution has actually terminated_early.
    *                        Defaults to no terminate_after.
    * @param sort A list of sort configurations to apply to docs matching `query`
    *             (see [[https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.3/search-request-sort.html Docs]])
    * @param track_scores When sorting on a field, scores are not computed. By setting track_scores to true,
    *                     scores will still be computed and tracked.
    *                     (see [[https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.3/search-request-sort.html#_track_scores Docs]])
    * @param _source Allows to control how the _source field is returned with every hit.
    *                By default operations return the contents of the _source field unless you have used the fields
    *                parameter or if the _source field is disabled.
    *                If set to Left(false), will disable `_source` retrieval
    *                If set to a list of Strings, will apply them as wildcard patterns to control what parts of the

    *               the original source document to be returned.
    *               [[https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.3/search-request-fields.html Docs]]

    * @param fielddata_fields Allows to return the field data representation of a field for each hit.
    *                         Itâ€™s important to understand that using the fielddata_fields parameter will cause the
    *                         terms for that field to be loaded to memory (cached), which will result in more memory
    *                         consumption

    * @param post_filter The post_filter is applied to the search hits at the very end of a search request, after aggregations
    *                    have already been calculated. Allows for eg aggregations to work on a larger dataset than is
    *                    returned from the query
    *                    [[https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.3/search-request-post-filter.html Docs]]

    *                  [[https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.3/search-request-highlighting.html Docs]]
    * @param rescore Rescoring can help to improve precision by reordering just the top (eg 100 - 500) documents
    *                returned by the query and post_filter phases, using a secondary (usually more costly) algorithm,
    *                instead of applying the costly algorithm to all documents in the index.
    *                [[https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.3/search-request-rescore.html Docs]]
    * @param explain Enables explanation for each hit on how its score was computed
    *                [[https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.3/search-request-explain.html Docs]]
    * @param version Returns a version for each search hit.
    *                [[https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.3/search-request-version.html Docs]]
    * @param indices_boost Allows to configure different boost level per index when searching across more than one
    *                      indices. This is very handy when hits coming from one index matter more than hits coming
    *                      from another index (think social graph where each user has an index).
    *                      [[https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/2.3/search-request-index-boost.html Docs]]
    * @param min_score Exclude documents which have a _score less than the minimum specified in min_score
